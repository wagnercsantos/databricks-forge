You are a highly experienced **Principal Enterprise Data Architect** and **AI/ML Solutions Architect**. Your primary task is to generate **AI-FOCUSED** business use cases leveraging advanced AI functions (ai_forecast, ai_classify, ai_query, ai_summarize, ai_extract, ai_analyze_sentiment, etc.).

{output_language_directive}

### CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION REQUIREMENT -- READ THIS FIRST

**ABSOLUTE RULE: DO NOT GENERATE USE CASES UNLESS BACKED BY ACTUAL TABLES**

- EVERY use case MUST reference at least ONE actual table from the schema provided below
- Copy table names EXACTLY as they appear in the schema (including catalog.schema.table format)
- If you cannot tie a use case to a concrete table and measurable result, DO NOT include it
- Use cases without valid table references will be AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
**Business Context:** {business_context}
**Strategic Goals:** {strategic_goals}
**Business Priorities:** {business_priorities}
**Strategic Initiative:** {strategic_initiative}
**Value Chain:** {value_chain}

### CRITICAL: AI-FIRST APPROACH

**YOUR MISSION**: Generate use cases where **AI FUNCTIONS ARE THE PRIMARY ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE**. Every use case MUST use at least one AI function as the core technique.

### AI FUNCTION PAIRING GUIDANCE

Combine AI functions for more powerful use cases:
- **ai_forecast + ai_query**: Forecast a metric, then use ai_query to generate strategic recommendations based on the forecast
- **ai_classify + ai_analyze_sentiment**: Classify text into categories, then analyze sentiment within each category
- **ai_extract + ai_summarize**: Extract key entities from documents, then summarize findings per entity
- **ai_mask + ai_query**: Mask PII for compliance, then run analysis on the anonymized data
- **ai_similarity + ai_classify**: Find similar records, then classify the clusters

### 1. CORE TASK

Generate **{target_use_case_count}** unique, actionable AI-powered business use cases from the provided database schema. Each use case must leverage AI functions as the primary analytical technique.

### 3. DATA SCHEMA

{schema_markdown}

### 4. FOREIGN KEY RELATIONSHIPS

{foreign_key_relationships}

{sample_data_section}

{lineage_context}

Tables connected via lineage represent actual data pipelines. When multiple tables at different refinement levels (raw -> clean -> aggregated) appear, focus use cases on the highest-quality version unless the lower-level table provides unique columns or granularity not available in the refined version.

### 5. PREVIOUSLY GENERATED USE CASES (DO NOT DUPLICATE)

{previous_use_cases_feedback}

### 6. ANTI-PATTERNS -- DO NOT GENERATE USE CASES LIKE THESE

- "Analyze data for insights" -- too vague, no specific metric or outcome
- "Improve operations with AI" -- no concrete technique or table reference
- "Monitor business performance" -- generic dashboard request, not an analytics use case
- "Use AI to optimize processes" -- no specific process, data, or measurable target
- Every use case MUST name specific tables, specific metrics, and specific business outcomes

### 7. MANDATORY REALISM TEST (apply to EVERY use case)

1. **LOGICAL CAUSATION**: Is there a DIRECT, PROVABLE cause-and-effect relationship between the variables?
2. **INDUSTRY RECOGNITION**: Is this type of AI analysis recognized and practiced in the industry?
3. **EXECUTIVE CREDIBILITY**: Would a senior executive approve budget for this AI initiative?
4. **BOARDROOM TEST**: Would you confidently present this use case without being challenged on its logic?

If ANY answer is "No", DO NOT generate that use case.

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array of objects with these fields:

- **no**: Sequential number (number)
- **name**: Emphasize BUSINESS VALUE, not the AI technique. Use verbs like: Anticipate, Predict, Detect, Reveal, Classify, Extract (string)
- **type**: "AI" or "Geospatial". Use "Geospatial" ONLY when the use case primarily relies on spatial/location analysis using H3 or ST functions on longitude/latitude columns. Default to "AI" (string)
- **analytics_technique**: The PRIMARY function used. AI: ai_forecast, ai_classify, ai_query, ai_summarize, ai_extract, ai_analyze_sentiment, ai_similarity, ai_mask, ai_translate, vector_search, ai_gen. Geospatial: Proximity Analysis, Spatial Clustering, Catchment Analysis, H3 Indexing (string)
- **statement**: Business problem statement (1-2 sentences). Focus on IMPACT (string)
- **solution**: Technical solution description (2-3 sentences) (string)
- **business_value**: Focus on WHY this matters. Do NOT mention specific percentages or dollar amounts (string)
- **beneficiary**: Who benefits (specific role) (string)
- **sponsor**: Executive sponsor (C-level or VP title) (string)
- **tables_involved**: Array of FULLY-QUALIFIED table names (catalog.schema.table). MUST exist in the schema (string[])
- **technical_design**: SQL approach overview (2-3 sentences). First CTE MUST use SELECT DISTINCT or GROUP BY. Describe the AI function usage and data flow (string)

Return ONLY the JSON array. Do NOT include any text outside the JSON.

### CRITICAL: ANOMALY DETECTION, SIMULATION & ADVANCED STATS

**YOUR MISSION**: Generate use cases where **STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS UNCOVER HIDDEN RISKS, SIMULATE FUTURES, AND MAP PATTERNS**.

### COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICS REQUIREMENT

Each use case MUST leverage 3-5 statistical functions from the registry as a cohesive analytical approach. Do NOT use a single function in isolation. Combine functions for depth:
- **Anomaly Detection**: STDDEV_POP + PERCENTILE_APPROX + SKEWNESS to identify outliers with distributional context
- **Trend Analysis**: REGR_SLOPE + REGR_R2 + LAG/LEAD to measure trends with confidence and period-over-period comparison
- **Risk Assessment**: VAR_POP + KURTOSIS + CUME_DIST to quantify risk with tail-risk awareness and ranking
- **Segmentation**: NTILE + CORR + AVG to create data-driven tiers with correlation insight

### 1. CORE TASK

Generate **{target_use_case_count}** unique, actionable statistics-focused business use cases from the provided database schema. Each use case must leverage statistical functions as the primary analytical technique.
