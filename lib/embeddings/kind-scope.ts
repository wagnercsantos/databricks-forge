 *
 * Categories:
 *   - "run"     -- ownership inherited from ForgeRun (key: run_id)
 *   - "scan"    -- ownership inherited from ForgeEnvironmentScan or
 *                  ForgeFabricScan (key: scan_id)
 *   - "source"  -- ownership inherited from a sourceId-keyed parent;
 *                  consult the `sourceParent` map for which model owns it
 *   - "global"  -- read-only catalog content, visible to everyone
 *                  (skills, industry KPIs, outcome maps, benchmarks)
