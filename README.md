# Databricks Forge

> **IMPORTANT: This is NOT a Databricks product.** This project was built by the Databricks Field Engineering team as a field accelerator. It is provided "as-is" subject to the [Databricks License](LICENSE) with no warranty and no official support. See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for support policy.

**Transform your Unity Catalog metadata into actionable, AI-generated use cases.**

Databricks Forge is a web application deployed as a [Databricks App](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html). Point it at your catalogs and schemas, and it uses LLM-powered analysis (via Databricks Model Serving) to discover, score, and export data-driven use cases -- without ever reading your actual data.

## Deployment (Databricks Apps)

The supported deployment path is the included `deploy.sh` script. It keeps resource bindings, auth mode, and Lakebase secret rotation behavior consistent and auditable.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] **A Databricks workspace** with Unity Catalog enabled
- [ ] **A SQL Warehouse** (Serverless or Pro) running in that workspace
- [ ] **[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html)** installed and authenticated
- [ ] **Workspace previews enabled**: **Databricks Apps - On-Behalf-Of User Authorization** must be turned on in your workspace Admin Settings under Previews (optional but recommended)

> **Lakebase is auto-provisioned.** The app creates its own Lakebase Autoscale project on first boot -- no manual database setup, no secret scopes, no resource bindings for the database.

</p>

### Step 1: Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/althrussell/databricks-forge.git
cd databricks-forge
./deploy.sh
```

Native password rotation and rollback examples:

```bash
# Rotate native password during deploy (recommended for production rotations)
./deploy.sh --rotate-lakebase-native-password

# Optional: print generated password to terminal (use with caution)
./deploy.sh --rotate-lakebase-native-password --print-generated-native-password

# Emergency rollback to OAuth mode
./deploy.sh --lakebase-auth-mode oauth
```

The deploy script discovers your SQL Warehouses, lets you pick one, creates
the app, uploads the code, and deploys. The premium model defaults to
`databricks-claude-opus-4-6` and the fast model to `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`.
The whole process takes 3-5 minutes.

### Step 2: Deploy completes

The script configures everything automatically -- resource bindings (SQL
warehouse, serving endpoints) and user authorization scopes (`sql`,
`catalog.tables:read`, `catalog.schemas:read`, `catalog.catalogs:read`,
`files.files`). No manual UI steps needed.

The platform will:

1. **Install dependencies** -- runs `npm install`
2. **Build** -- runs `npm run build` (generates Prisma client, builds the Next.js standalone server, copies static assets)
3. **Inject** environment variables from resource bindings
4. **Start** the app using `scripts/start.sh` (from `app.yaml`), which:
   - **Auto-provisions Lakebase** on first deploy (skipped on subsequent deploys)
   - Runs `prisma db push` (creates all tables on first deploy, applies additive changes on subsequent deploys)
   - Starts the Next.js standalone server on port 8000

> First deploy takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deploys are faster.

### Step 3: Verify

Open the app URL in your browser. You should see the Forge dashboard.

You can also check the health endpoint:

```bash
APP_URL=$(databricks apps get databricks-forge --output json | jq -r '.url')
curl -s "$APP_URL/api/health" | jq .
```

A healthy response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "warehouse": "connected",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

---

### Updating the app

Pull the latest changes and re-run `./deploy.sh`. The script detects the existing app and updates it. Schema changes in `prisma/schema.prisma` are applied automatically on the next startup.

---

### Local Development (No Serverless Egress)

For environments that restrict serverless egress, or to test locally before
deploying, Forge can run on your machine pointing at a remote workspace.

> **New to Node.js?** Install Node 20+ from https://nodejs.org first. Verify
> with `node -v` and `npm -v`.

```bash
npm install                                                        # Install dependencies (~60s first time)
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com  # One-time OAuth login
bash .deploy_local.sh                                              # Provisions Lakebase, selects warehouse, writes .env.local
npm run dev                                                        # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

The first page load takes 10-15 seconds while Next.js compiles. You should
see the Forge dashboard. No PAT or long-lived credentials are stored on disk
-- the app authenticates via the Databricks CLI's OAuth session.

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) or [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
for full details and troubleshooting.

### Environment variables at runtime

| Variable | Source | How it's set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Workspace URL | Auto-injected by platform |
| `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` | Service principal OAuth client ID | Auto-injected by platform |
| `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Service principal OAuth client secret | Auto-injected by platform |
| `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` | SQL Warehouse ID | Set by `deploy.sh` in `app.yaml` |
| `DATABRICKS_SERVING_ENDPOINT` | Premium Model Serving endpoint name | Set by `deploy.sh` (default: `databricks-claude-opus-4-6`) |
| `DATABRICKS_SERVING_ENDPOINT_FAST` | Fast Model Serving endpoint name | Set by `deploy.sh` (default: `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`) |
| `DATABRICKS_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` | Embedding Model Serving endpoint name | Set by `deploy.sh` (default: `databricks-qwen3-embedding-0-6b`) |
| `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT_NAME` | Lakebase endpoint resource name | Auto-generated at startup by `scripts/provision-lakebase.mjs` |
| `LAKEBASE_POOLER_HOST` | Lakebase pooler hostname | Auto-generated at startup by `scripts/provision-lakebase.mjs` |
| `LAKEBASE_USERNAME` | Lakebase runtime username | Auto-generated at startup by `scripts/provision-lakebase.mjs` |
| `LAKEBASE_AUTH_MODE` | Runtime DB auth mode | Set by `deploy.sh` override or startup default (`native_password`) |

| `LAKEBASE_REQUIRE_NATIVE_PASSWORD` | Native password policy guardrail | Optional; when `true`, startup fails if native password is missing |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Lakebase connection string | Local development fallback only |

> `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, and `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` are injected automatically. Runtime mode is `native_password` by default (pooler endpoint); OAuth mode remains available as an explicit deploy override.

### Auth model

The app uses **two complementary auth models** ([docs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/auth)):

**User authorization (OBO)** -- the logged-in user's identity and UC permissions:

| API | Scope | What runs as the user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQL Statement Execution | `sql` | All metadata queries, generated SQL, health check |
| Workspace REST API | -- | Notebook export runs as the app service principal (see below) |
| Unity Catalog metadata | `catalog.catalogs:read`, `catalog.schemas:read`, `catalog.tables:read` | `SHOW CATALOGS/SCHEMAS/TABLES`, `information_schema` |

**App authorization (service principal)** -- the app's own identity for background operations:

| Resource | Permission | What runs as the SP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQL Warehouse | **Can use** | Background pipeline tasks |
| Model Serving endpoint (premium) | **Can query** | Use case generation, scoring, SQL generation |
| Model Serving endpoint (fast) | **Can query** | Business context, table filtering, domain clustering, deduplication |
| Model Serving endpoint (embedding) | **Can query** | Embedding generation for semantic search |
| Workspace REST API | **Can manage** | Notebook export (mkdirs + import to `/Shared/forge_gen/`) |
| Unity Catalog | **USE CATALOG / USE SCHEMA / SELECT** | Background metadata queries |
| `system.access.table_lineage` | **SELECT** | Lineage graph walking |
| Genie Spaces | **Can manage** | Create, update, and trash Genie Spaces |

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "DATABASE_URL is not set and Lakebase auto-provisioning is not available" | Running locally without `.env` | Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` for local dev |
| "Lakebase provisioning returned empty URL" | SP lacks permission to create Lakebase projects | Ensure the app's service principal can manage Lakebase resources |
| "Create project failed (403)" | Lakebase Autoscale not available in region | Check [supported regions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp/projects/authentication); for local fallback use a manual `DATABASE_URL` |
| Native mode fails with missing password | Password not provided and strict mode enabled | Use `./deploy.sh --rotate-lakebase-native-password` or provide `--lakebase-native-password` |
| Schema push fails at startup | Lakebase compute still waking from scale-to-zero | Restart the app -- compute wakes automatically and retries succeed |
| "Failed to connect to warehouse" | Warehouse binding missing or stopped | Verify `sql-warehouse` resource is configured and warehouse is running |
| "Model serving request failed" | Serving endpoint binding missing | Verify `serving-endpoint` resource is configured. If fast tasks fail, check `serving-endpoint-fast` or remove it to fall back to premium |
| Semantic search returns no results | Embeddings not yet generated | Run an estate scan or pipeline; embeddings are generated automatically after each scan/run |
| "USE CATALOG denied" on discovery | User lacks UC grants | The logged-in user needs `USE CATALOG` / `USE SCHEMA` / `SELECT` on the catalogs they want to discover |
| Lineage discovery returns 0 tables | Missing lineage permissions | Grant `SELECT` on `system.access.table_lineage` to the user |

### Deployment checklist

```
[ ] 1. Databricks CLI installed and authenticated
[ ] 2. ./deploy.sh completed (creates app, binds resources, sets scopes, deploys)
[ ] 3. Health check passes: <app-url>/api/health
```

> Lakebase is auto-provisioned on first deploy -- no manual database setup needed.
> Resources (warehouse, endpoints) and user scopes are configured automatically by deploy.sh.

## What It Does

1. **Configure** -- enter your business name, select Unity Catalog scope, choose your industry, and set priorities.
2. **Discover** -- a 10-step AI pipeline extracts metadata, generates use cases, clusters them into business domains, scores them, generates runnable SQL, quantifies business value, and produces Genie Space recommendations. See [FORGE_ANALYSIS.md](FORGE_ANALYSIS.md) for the full breakdown.
3. **Analyse** -- review scored use cases, explore business value estimates, implementation roadmap, stakeholder mapping, and executive synthesis.
4. **Activate** -- deploy Genie Spaces, AI/BI dashboards, SQL notebooks, and AI catalog comments. Export results as Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, or portfolio deliverables.
5. **Track** -- follow use cases from discovery through delivery to measured business value, with voting, stalled alerts, and value capture.

### Key Features

- Discovers both **AI** use cases (ai_forecast, ai_classify, ai_query, etc.) and **Statistical** use cases (anomaly detection, trend analysis, geospatial, etc.)
- Scores every use case on **priority**, **feasibility**, **impact**, and **overall value**
- Automatically clusters use cases into **business domains and subdomains**
- **Business Value Intelligence** -- financial quantification (dollar-range estimates), roadmap phasing, executive synthesis, and stakeholder analysis
- **Genie Space generation** -- multi-pass engine producing column intelligence, semantic SQL, trusted queries, benchmarks, and metric view proposals
- **Genie Space health checks** -- deterministic scoring, automated fix workflow, and benchmark feedback loop for continuous improvement
- **AI/BI dashboards** -- auto-generated Lakeview dashboard recommendations per domain
- **AI catalog comments** -- industry-aware table and column descriptions with bulk apply/undo
- **Ask Forge** -- RAG-powered conversational assistant with SQL proposals, dashboard actions, and Genie Space deployment
- **Data estate intelligence** -- environment scanning with health scoring, lineage, ERD, governance gap analysis
- **Industry benchmarks** -- 562 reference use cases across 11 industries grounding LLM outputs in real-world data
- **Knowledge Base** -- upload strategy packs, data dictionaries, and governance policies to enrich AI context
- **Fabric / Power BI migration** -- scan PBI workspaces, propose gold schema DDL, translate DAX to SQL
- Deduplicates and ranks results so the highest-value opportunities surface first
- Supports **20+ languages** for generated documentation
- **Real-time status messages** during pipeline execution (e.g. "Filtering tables (batch 2 of 5)...")
- **Privacy-first**: reads only metadata by default (table/column names and schemas). Optional [data sampling](FORGE_ANALYSIS.md#data-sampling) can be enabled for improved SQL accuracy

## Pipeline Steps

The "Discover Usecases" pipeline runs 10 steps. The frontend polls for progress in real time.

| Step | Name | What it does | Progress |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Business Context** | Generates strategic goals, value chain, and revenue model via Model Serving | 10% |
| 2 | **Metadata Extraction** | Queries `information_schema` for tables, columns, foreign keys, and metric views | 18% |
| 3 | **Asset Discovery** | Discovers existing Genie Spaces, dashboards, and metric views in scope (optional) | 22% |
| 4 | **Table Filtering** | Classifies tables as business-relevant vs technical via Model Serving (JSON mode) | 30% |
| 5 | **Use Case Generation** | Generates AI and statistical use cases in parallel batches via Model Serving (JSON mode) | 45% |
| 6 | **Domain Clustering** | Assigns domains and subdomains via Model Serving, merges small domains | 55% |
| 7 | **Scoring & Dedup** | Scores on priority/feasibility/impact, removes duplicates via Model Serving | 65% |
| 8 | **SQL Generation** | Generates runnable Databricks SQL per use case via Model Serving (streaming) | 80% |
| 9 | **Business Value Analysis** | Financial quantification, roadmap phasing, executive synthesis, stakeholder analysis | 90% |
| 10 | **Genie Recommendations** | Multi-pass Genie Space generation with benchmarks and metric view proposals (background) | 100% |

The Dashboard Engine also runs in the background alongside step 10, producing AI/BI dashboard recommendations per domain.

Each step updates its status and a human-readable **status message** in Lakebase (e.g. "Scanning catalog main...", "Scoring domain: Customer Analytics (14 use cases)..."). The frontend polls every 3 seconds and displays the latest message alongside the progress stepper.

## Lakebase (Zero-Touch Auto-Provisioning)

The app persists all state (pipeline runs, use cases, exports) in [Lakebase Autoscaling](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp/projects/authentication) -- a Postgres-compatible OLTP database managed by Databricks. The schema is managed by [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/).

### How it works

**No manual database setup is required.** When deployed as a Databricks App, the app automatically:

1. **Creates a Lakebase Autoscale project** (`databricks-forge`) on first boot using the platform-injected service principal credentials
2. **Uses direct endpoint for startup DDL/schema sync** (`prisma db push`, extensions, index setup)
3. **Bootstraps a native runtime role** (`forge_app_runtime` by default) and grants required privileges
4. **Runs runtime traffic through pooler endpoint** in `native_password` mode by default
5. **Allows explicit OAuth fallback** via `./deploy.sh --lakebase-auth-mode oauth`

Use `deploy.sh` for deterministic password lifecycle:

- `./deploy.sh --rotate-lakebase-native-password` to rotate password during deployment
- `./deploy.sh --lakebase-native-password "<value>" --lakebase-auth-mode native_password` to pin an explicit password

### First deploy vs subsequent deploys

| Scenario | What happens | Extra time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **First deploy** | Creates Lakebase project, waits for it to be ready, creates all tables | ~30-60s |
| **Subsequent deploys** | Detects existing project, skips creation, syncs schema (no-op if unchanged) | ~1-2s |
| **After idle (scale-to-zero)** | Compute wakes automatically on first connection | ~200ms |

### Redeployments are safe

`prisma db push` is idempotent: if the tables already exist and match the schema, it does nothing. If new tables or columns were added to the Prisma schema, it creates them. It never drops existing tables or columns.

## Configuration Options

These map to the form fields on the `/configure` page:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Business Name** | Yes | -- | Organisation or project name |
| **UC Metadata** | Yes | -- | Unity Catalog scope: `catalog`, `catalog.schema`, or comma-separated list |
| **Business Priorities** | No | Increase Revenue | Multi-select from 10 predefined priorities |
| **Strategic Goals** | No | Auto-generated | Custom goals for scoring alignment |
| **Business Domains** | No | Auto-detected | Focus domains (e.g. "Risk, Finance, Marketing") |
| **AI Model** | No | databricks-claude-opus-4-6 | Model Serving endpoint for LLM calls (chat completions) |
| **Languages** | No | English | Target languages for generated documentation |

### Cost governance (optional)

Both options below are optional and independent. Leave them unset to keep the current behaviour.

```bash
# Attach a serverless budget policy to the Databricks App and the
# Lakebase project for cost attribution.
./deploy.sh --budget-policy-id "<policy-id>"

# Tag the Lakebase project (repeatable). The Databricks Apps API does
# not accept tags on the App resource, so these tags apply only to the
# Lakebase project. On redeploys the tags are reconciled via PATCH.
./deploy.sh --tag team=data-eng --tag cost-center=1234

# Both flags can be combined.
./deploy.sh --budget-policy-id "<policy-id>" --tag env=prod
```

**Default tags.** Passing `--tag` at least once opts in to tag management. In that case, two default tags are injected unless overridden with `--tag <same-key>=<value>`:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | `databricks_forge` |
| `owner` | email of the user running the deploy (skipped when unresolvable) |

When `--tag` is not passed, no tags are applied and existing tags on the Lakebase project are left untouched (neither the create spec nor the reconcile PATCH fires).

- **First deploy**: values are included in the initial `createProject` spec and the `apps create`/`apps update` calls.
- **Redeploys**: `deploy.sh` re-applies `budget_policy_id` on the App; on the Lakebase side, the app reconciles `spec.budget_policy_id` and `spec.custom_tags` via PATCH on the next boot (non-fatal on failure). Updating `custom_tags` fully replaces the existing list.

---

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server (Turbopack)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript strict type checking
npm test           # Run tests (Vitest)
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system design, layer responsibilities, and data flow. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for local development setup instructions.

---

## Privacy

By default, Forge reads **metadata only** -- schema names, table names, column names, data types, and comments. All LLM prompts contain only structural metadata.

When **Data Sampling** is enabled in Settings, the app reads a configurable number of rows (5-50) per table during SQL generation. Sampled data is sent to the AI model to improve SQL accuracy but is **not persisted** -- it exists only in memory during the generation step. See [FORGE_ANALYSIS.md - Privacy Model](FORGE_ANALYSIS.md#privacy-model) for the full breakdown.
